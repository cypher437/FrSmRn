Mathematical formula can be expressed in a few ways. There are hundreds of different Mathematical symbols which can be used, but all occur within \verb|$|. A single \verb|$| on either side of an expression will make it render as inline mathematics $\sum_{i=1}^{n}i=\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$. You can also use double \verb|$$| for larger equations.

$$\int_{a}^{b}f(x)dx=\left[F(x)\right]_{a}^{b}=F(b)-F(a)$$
